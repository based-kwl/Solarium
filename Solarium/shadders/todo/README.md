# Solarium Shadders

This yeeted branch is for shadder (shader) development.

There is 2 folders, `shadders` and `shadders-rasterization`. Both currently contain pseudocode GLSL that is supposed to be somewhat easily adaptable once Solarium becomes a working demo. `shadders` has shaders for Ray-Tracing and `shadders-rasterization` has shaders for Rasterization.
